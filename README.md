## DarwinDraw 
Customizable animating text rendering and tools.

### Raster tools (work-in-progress)
Pixel level operators for raw binary image manipulation (no anti-alaising)
- Skeletonization
- Dialation
- Erosion

### Vector tools (to-do)
- Convert from raster
- Re-sampling: best-fit reduce points, denoise, smooth
- Distortion: 2D boundary constraint / grid 
- Animation
